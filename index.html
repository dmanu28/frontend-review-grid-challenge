    <h4>SiR makes some risky creative choices in Chasing Summer that pays off and pushes him into a new creative plateau of Los Angeles’ alternative soul 
        sect inching toward mainstream.
    </h4>
    <p>Top Dawg Entertainment has grown significantly within the past several years outside of housing the best artist from the West Coast. This includes adding 
        more contemporary R&B acts including SZA and Zacari alongside the label’s soul music nucleus SiR.

        The Inglewood-based singer/songwriter already enjoyed significant writing credits before dropping his breakout Seven Sundays album in 2015. Signing to TDE,
         dropping two buzzworthy EPs and a sophomore album seemed like a suitable career trajectory for someone who already had writing credits with notables
          from Anita Baker to Stevie Wonder.
        
        Over a year and a half since November SiR maintains artistic credibility on Chasing Summer. An album filled with some engaging songwriting choices, masterful
         vocals, great guest features and production that blends cool alternative West Coast vibes with silky sounding instrumentation, SiR creates a body of work 
         that ranks amongst the most polished R&B and soul releases one will hear all year.

    <h4>Top Dawg Entertainment's SiR made a significant splash with his 2018 album November, and now he's back with its proper follow-up</h4>
    <p>Chasing Summer sees the Inglewood artist further expand upon his sound, with a smooth delivery and slick production. "When I first got in the game I was a 
        recording engineer so you know I still cut all my vocals, I still mix my album," SiR said of Chasing Summer.
        "This one is probably a culmination of the last four years," he added. "The oldest record on the new project is four years old, so I mean you know music is 
        weird sometimes like that."

    <h4>As promised, SiR has delivered his sophomore album Chasing Summer</h4>
    <p>"It's an evolution," SiR said of Chasing Summer in a statement. "I have my own sound that's been locked in for the last five years, but I take a lot of risks 
        from what I'm saying and how I transition from song to song. There's a lot of growth."

    <h4>This album has consistent themes beautifully communicated through charmingly impressive vocals. The features were nothing short of iconic, featuring the 
        likes of Kendrick Lamar, Jill Scott and Lil Wayne amongst others!</h4>
    <p>Sir’s latest offering “Chasing the Summer” feels like an afternoon after a taxing day, where you come home to a comfortable & warmly lit space, with your 
        marijuana pre-rolled and a  dessert you enjoy so much you just have to eat it slowly to really savour the taste. A theme that permeates this entire body 
        of work from the very Title and the ushering first track;  but takes a few detours down a nostalgic memory lane where he longs for the all too familiar
         simplicity of Inglewood his hometown, vs the seductive allure of Los Angeles. I’m not sure whether he is metaphorically comparing both cities to contrasting 
         lovers or this nomadic dilemma many internationally touring artists face is being personified as two contrasting love affairs?

    <h4>Even after two fantastic albums, I still wouldn’t be able to recognize SiR if he ran up on me in the streets and gave me a wedgie. In a sense, that’s what makes 
        him such an appealing
         artist</h4>
    <p>In my opinion, there is no possible way you can appreciate “Chasing Summer” as much as you’re supposed to. Not only is the singing you get on it fantastic, 
        but the instrumentals on it are timeless-sounding, the subject-matters and lyrics are meaningful, the vibes are magical, and SiR’s veteran approach to the 
        project as a whole is impressive.

        I’ve heard so many different approaches to love these last couple of years, but on the real, I haven’t heard one similar to SiR’s. 
        Regardless of the ups-and-downs that comes with being in a romantic relationship, the TDE singer doesn’t stress a single sentiment of his… It’s almost like
         he is the type of guy that remembers to ‘stop, drop and roll’ when he’s on fire. Aside from relationships, SiR also tackles the idea of rolling up and 
         making money with the same calm he tackles relationships… It’s almost like he is the kind of guy that remembers to run in zig-zags when an alligator is 
         chasing him.</p>
